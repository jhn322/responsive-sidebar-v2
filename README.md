# Simple Responsive Sidebar

A simple responsive sidebar menu with icons that opens and closes in a press of a button. A simple JavaScript function allows the menu to open to reveal the category names along side the icons on hover as well as touch events.

## Improvements

Several improvements in JS to allow the sidebar to dynamically open and close on mouse hover on delay and more mobile optimisation by allowing the user to swipe to open & close the sidebar with touch events.
